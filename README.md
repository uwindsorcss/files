# CSS File Repository
A file sharing repository for the Computer Science Society.

## Where to Find Files
Files can be accessed from [GitHub Pages](https://uwindsorcss.github.io/files).

## Categorizing Files
- Please place any files under the `dir` directory.  
- If the file fits in a particular folder, place it there or create a new one for it.
- Else, place the file in the `misc` folder.

Note: Make sure to not use spaces in file names. For example, instead of `my presentation.pdf`, name it `my-presentation.pdf`

## NOTE: Before Pushing

Make sure you **build** the index files. This can be done by simply running `python3 build.py`
